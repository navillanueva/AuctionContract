# Coding Interview Problem

The problem statement can be found in this repository under the name of "solidity test.txt"

It requires to create a smartcontract that implements the following functionality.
1. Initialize the auction with a list of items and their starting bids.
2. Allow users to place bids on items.
3. Automatically determine the highest bidder for each item when the auction ends.

With the follwoing functions:
- A function to initialize the auction with a list of items and their starting bids. This function should only be accessible to the contract owner.
- A function to allow users to place bids on items. This function should only be accessible to non-owner users.
- A function to determine the highest bidder for each item when the auction ends. This function should only be accessible to the contract owner.

And these questions:
1. Implement the auction smart contract
2. Write test cases for the functions
3. Explain your design choices and how/why you tested the contract to ensure that it is working as intended (comment your code using NatSpec)

Part of the test are not fully implemented, but would like to know if I am missing any test that i should create (just the idea no need for the full code)
```
