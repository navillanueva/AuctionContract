**Problem:**

You are working on a smart contract for a simple auction system. The auction system should allow users to place bids on items and automatically determine the highest bidder when the auction ends.

The smart contract should have the following functionality:

1. Initialize the auction with a list of items and their starting bids.
2. Allow users to place bids on items.
3. Automatically determine the highest bidder for each item when the auction ends.


The smart contract should have the following variables:

- A mapping from item names to their current highest bid and the address of the highest bidder.
- An array of items that are up for auction.
- A start time and end time for the auction.

The smart contract should have the following functions:

- A function to initialize the auction with a list of items and their starting bids. This function should only be accessible to the contract owner.
- A function to allow users to place bids on items. This function should only be accessible to non-owner users.
- A function to determine the highest bidder for each item when the auction ends. This function should only be accessible to the contract owner.


******************Questions:******************

1. Implement the auction smart contract
2. Write test cases for the functions
3. Explain your design choices and how/why you tested the contract to ensure that it is working as intended (comment your code using NatSpec)
